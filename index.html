<h1>Steven Brownstone's Retro Website</h1>
<p>This version of my website honors old-school pure HTML academic websites like my father's 
  <a href="https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~dbrownst/">David Brownstone</a> </p>
  I have many privileges and my father being an academic is one. Although, I have avoided any discrete choice modeling so far in my work.
<h2>Backgound</h2>
<p>I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in economics at the University of California San Diego. My research is in development economics, agricultural economics, and political economy. 
I partner with CEGIS and J-PAL South Asia for my projects in India.
I have a bachelor's degree from Brown University, where I majored in Math-Economics.
Before starting at Brown, I worked at IDinsight. First, as an associate in Lusaka, Zambia and then as a Junior Economist in New Delhi, India</p>
